Write a program to enter the marks of a student in four subjects. Then calculate the
total and aggregate, display the grade obtained by the student. If the student scores an
aggregate greater than 75%, then the grade is Distinction. If aggregate is 60>= and <75,
then the grade is First Division. If aggregate is 50 >= and <60, then the grade is Second
Division. If aggregate is 40>= and <50, then the grade is Third Division. Else the grade
is Fail.
Sample Input & Output:
Enter the marks in python: 90
Enter the marks in c programming: 91
Enter the marks in Mathematics: 92
Enter the marks in Physics: 93
Total= 366
Aggregate = 91.5
DISTINCTION
Test cases:
a) 18, 76,93,65
b) 73,78,79,75
c) 98,106,120,95
d) 96,73, -85,95
e) 78,59.8,76,79
