A year has 365 days but leap year consists of 366 days. This one day is added in the month
of February. This month which generally has 28 days and also known as the shortest
month in a year would get added with an extra day, which gives us a total of 29 days in
that month. It is based on the Georgian calendar. Compile and Execute the C program
for checking out whether a given year is a leap year or not.

#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int year;
    int d;
    int m;
    printf("enter date;");
    scanf("%d",&d);
    printf("enter month");
    scanf("%d",&m);
    printf("enter year:");
    scanf("%d",&year);
    if (d>=1&&d<=31)
    if(m>=1&&m<=12)
    if(year>0) 
    {
        if(year%400==0)
        {
            printf("%d is a leap year:",year);
        }
        else if(year%100==0)
        {
            printf("%d is not a leap year",year);
        }
        else if(year%4==0)
        {
            printf("%d is a leap year:",year);
        }}
        else
        {
            printf("%d is not a leap year:",year);
        }

        else
        printf("INVALID");
        return 0;
        }
