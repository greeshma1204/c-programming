Compile and Execute the C program to find whether the person is eligible for vote or not. And
if that particular person is not eligible, then print how many years are left to be eligible.
solution:


#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
  int age;

  printf("Input the age of the candidate : ");
  scanf("%d",&age);
  if (age<18)
     {
       printf("Sorry, You are not eligible to caste your vote.\n");
       printf("You would be able to caste your vote after %d year.\n",18-age);
     }
  else
     printf("Congratulation! You are eligible for casting your vote.\n");
}
